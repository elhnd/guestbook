route => link between the request path and a PHP callable (controllers), a function that creates the HTTP response for that request
symfony console list make => list all command vavailable under a diven namespace

Configurations formats => Symfony supports YAML, XML, PHP and PHP attributes out of the box.
Configuration related to packages => YAML is the best choice.
Configuration related to PHP code => attributes are better choice. The configuration is next to the code that it configures.
Symfony exposes the request data through a Request object. When Symfony sees a controller argument whith this type-hint, it 
    automaticalyy knows to pass it to you!;

A great debug helper is the Symfony dump() function. It is always available and allows you to dump complex 
    variables in a nice interactive format.

symfony var:export => check all environment variables exposed by sSymfony.

Symfony Components => Packages that implement core features and low level abstractions that most applications need (routing, console, HTTP client, cache, ...)

Symfony Bundles => Packages that add high-level features or provide integrations with third-party libraries (bundles are mostly contributed by the community)
